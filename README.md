# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis

This is a training project based on a dataset available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabdulw/ecommerce-customer-data).
 
Our goal with this analysis is to create a model to predict money spent by users based on various factors and figure out which factor has the greatest influence on spending and how the company should proceed in order to maximise its revenue.
